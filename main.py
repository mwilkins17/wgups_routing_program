# Main function
def main():
    """
    Main function to run the WGUPS Routing Program.

    Process Flow:
    1. Load package data, distance matrix, and address data from respective CSV files.
    2. Create and initialize three trucks with their IDs, start locations, and start times.
    3. Assign specific packages to each truck based on predefined package IDs.
    4. Optimize delivery for each truck using the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm.
    5. Provide a menu for user interaction with four main options:
        - View final delivery status of all packages and total mileage.
        - Lookup the delivery status of a single package at a specified time.
        - View delivery statuses of all packages at a specified time.
        - Exit the program.
    6. Validate user input for menu selections, package IDs, and time formats.
    7. Process user requests and loop until the user chooses to exit.

    Time Complexity:
    - Data Loading: O(n), where n is the total size of the CSV files.
    - Delivery: O(t^2), where t is the number of packages per truck.
    - Menu Loop: O(1) to O(n), depending on user interaction.
